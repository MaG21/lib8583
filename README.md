Why another library to parse ISO 8583 messages?

I'm disappointed at the current libre C/Ruby implementations, they lack a clean
and robust interface.

The goal is to make bindings for several other programming languages, for now
I'm planing on.

    1. Ruby
    2. JavaScript
    3. Python (depends on the project's success)
