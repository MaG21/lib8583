Why another library to parse ISO 8583 messages?

I'm disappointed at the current libre C/Ruby implementations, whereas languages like Erlang and Haskell provides state of the art implementations with a clean and robust interface.

But the goal is to make bindings for several other programming languages, for now I'm planing on.

    Ruby
    JavaScript
    Python (depends on the project's success)
